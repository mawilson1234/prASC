The efficient branch is an in-progress version of prASC.py that is set up to not reprocess
sentences/questions for which data already exists in results files. For this to work,
results files must have the names prASC assigns them ('results.csv' for sentences, 'subject_question_info.txt' and
'question_summary.txt' for questions, and 'results_combined.csv' for the CSV combining sentences and questions),
and these files must be in the user-specified output directory. If nocombine is set, the script looks for
existing results info in the uncombined results files; if it is not set, it looks for info in results_combined.csv.

It uses this info to construct a list of filenames already in the results files, and removes files with those
names from the list of files to process for sentences/questions. This means that any ASC files you have not
yet processed should not have the same name as those in the existing results files in order for them to be
properly processed. In addition, it will ignore directory information when comparing files in the directory
that is to be processed with those specified in the results file, and only compare file names. Take this into
account when setting your directories in the parameters file.
