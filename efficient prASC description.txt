 The efficient branch is an in-progress version of prASC.py that is set up 
 to not reprocess sentences/questions for which data already exists in results 
 files. For this to work, results files must have the names prASC assigns them 
 ('results.csv' for sentences, 'subject_question_info.txt' and 'question_summary.txt' 
 for questions, and 'results_combined.csv' for the CSV combining sentences and 
 questions), and these files must be in the user-specified output directory. 
 If nocombine is set, the script looks for existing results info in the uncombined 
 results files; if it is not set, it looks for info in results_combined.csv.

It uses this info to construct a list of filenames already in the results files, 
and removes files with those names from the list of files to process for sentences/questions. 
This means that any ASC files you have not yet processed should not have the 
same name as those in the existing results files in order for them to be properly
processed. In addition, it will ignore directory information when comparing files
in the directory that is to be processed with those specified in the results file,
and only compare file names. Take this into account when setting your directories 
in the parameters file.

This all assumes that you have not modified your configuration settings between 
runs; if you modify configuration settings related to column names in your 
results files between runs, prASC will not be able to detect which files have 
already been processed, and will reprocess everything.

In order to accommodate users who may wish to reprocess all sentences and 
questions, this version of prASC adds two new options: '--resentences' ('-rs')
and '--requestions' ('-rq'), which will reprocess all results for sentences and
questions respectively. Note that if you have deleted ASC files which are represented
in the  results files from the directory to be processed, this will result in
that information being lost.
